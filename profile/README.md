## 1. What is AI Agentic?

To start, let's define agentic AI. Simply put, agentic AI refers to AI systems that can act autonomously—meaning they don’t need constant human instructions to function. Think of it like a robot that can make decisions and take actions on its own without needing someone to tell it what to do every time.

In traditional AI systems, machines typically react to commands or follow pre-set rules. But agentic AI has the ability to make choices based on what it observes and learns. It...
